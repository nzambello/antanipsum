# AntanIpsum
A node fetcher for [antanipsum.it](https://www.antanipsum.it/). It can copy a Lorem Ipsum into clipboard or print it to stdout.

The correct description is the one presented in Italian by the website I refer to:

> Generatore di testo Lorem Ipsum pi√π scribai con confaldin

Every credit goes to its creators, I made only this handy cli.

I made this utility to directly copy a funny Lorem Ipsum, easily.
